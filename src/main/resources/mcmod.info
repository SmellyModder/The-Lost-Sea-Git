  "description": "Long ago in the overworld a man known as Atlas was being attacked from evil forces of what is only known as pure darkness on earth. Atlas along with his trusted warlocks we're able to craft a portal to another world and use the portal's energy to push back the dark forces, it was strong enough to push the darkness away from consuming the overworld, little did they know the darkness was able to slip through and get to the other world which is comprised mostly of water. Unfortunately the darkness was able to thrive greater in the other world known as 'The Lost Sea' then the overworld, but they didn't know to one faitful day. The darkness came back stronger striking the main city of the people of Atlantis. Barely pushing through, they defended Atlantis. Now knowing of the true power the darkness they needed new defenses, so they faught fire with fire. Atlas ordered the creation of powerful golems capable of weaking the darkness. These golems became the 'Guardians' that you know on earth. On the bad side, the Guardians we're made with dark magic. The first Guardian named Aegeaon, known as 'The Eldest One', eventually became so powerful and the darkness had consumed his thoughts. Aegeaon led a invasion on Atlantis killing nearly all life in Atlantis. Before the guardians had completely destroyed Atlantis, Atlas closed the gates to the Lost Sea and sent some guardians to the overworld to guard temples that had supplies to open the portal to the sea, in fear that the darkness would spread further.",
